### Forward voltage at a specified current

From **ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS** (Tamb = 25 °C, unless otherwise specified),
At a forward current of 10 mA, the forward voltage V<sub>F</sub> is typically maximum up to 1 V at 25 °C.

### Maximum reverse voltage
From **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS** (Tamb = 25 °C, unless otherwise specified),
The maximum repetitive reverse voltage (V<sub>RRM</sub>) is 100 V
A common rating for blocking DC reverse voltage is 75 V

### Maximum forward current
From **ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS** (Tamb = 25 °C, unless otherwise specified),
Forward continuous current (I<sub>F</sub>): 300 mA

### Operating temperature range
Storage temperature range (T<sub>stg</sub>): –65 °C to +150 °C (safe device storage)
Junction temperature (maximum operating temperature) is up to 175 °C.

### One real application where this diode is used

The 1N4148 is widely used as a small-signal in high-speed digital signal switching, such as logic gate protection.
